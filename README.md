🧱 SOLID Principles in Object-Oriented Design
This repository demonstrates the SOLID principles, the five core principles of object-oriented programming and design, with clear examples in JavaScript (or any language of your choice).

📚 What are SOLID Principles?
SOLID is an acronym representing five principles that help developers write cleaner, scalable, and maintainable code.

| Principle                               | Description                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **S** - Single Responsibility Principle | A class should have only one reason to change                                                 |
| **O** - Open/Closed Principle           | Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification                    |
| **L** - Liskov Substitution Principle   | Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types                                           |
| **I** - Interface Segregation Principle | Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use                          |
| **D** - Dependency Inversion Principle  | High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions |

💡 Why SOLID Matters
Easier to maintain and refactor

Encourages reusable and testable code

Improves collaboration in large codebases

Enhances system scalability and robustness
